# Machine Learning Challenge 2023 Submission Details

**Actually, all of this comes from a new Large Language Model (LLM) named "im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot."** I didn't write any part of the code myself; I only handled the training and converted the Python code to the Jupyter Notebook format. It was really fun learning how LLMs have become so much more powerful by May 2024.

## Motivation and Discovery

Before this, I hadn't studied any machine learning. I'm just a first-year student, and I didn't choose machine learning as part of my course at university. So, this has been a great opportunity to explore whether studying machine learning is right for me.

I decided to join this challenge because I received an email from **"Informatics Peer Assisted Learning"** yesterday. It mentioned that I could get a **Limited Edition Signed Ian Mackie Certificate**, which sounded incredibly special – I couldn't believe it!

After that, I learned about the most secretive LLM in May 2024, known as **"im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot."** It's free and only accessible at **[chat.lmsys.org](https://chat.lmsys.org/)**. Maybe it’s from OpenAI??? Until now (09/05/2024), no one knew.

Many developers have told me that this LLM is more powerful than OpenAI GPT-4-Turbo-0409 and other LLMs that came before it. This seemed like the perfect chance to try it out. (After analyzing whether AI can replace our machine learning jobs, I concluded that it may.)

## Project Summary and Results

I spent around 5 hours on this project, and I wonder if my solution might be the one with the best accuracy. Sometimes I feel like I'm cheating, but there's nothing on the GitHub page that says I can't use AI. And since this isn't coursework, I'm in the clear.

It was a lot of fun, and I learned more about machine learning while doing this, even though I'm not formally studying it. However, if my solution is the one with the best accuracy, I don't need a Fitbit. Most importantly, I'm excited about the chance to get a **Limited Edition Signed Ian Mackie Certificate!**

I am sorry to say that I used LLM (also known as cheating) to achieve a **99.89% accuracy rate**. I will upload a screenshot showing how I prompted the LLM to complete this task.

## Reflection

According to the GitHub read me page, I think **"Creative solutions"** may include using LLM, but I'm not entirely sure. However, it was a fun experience, especially since **"any computer science approach is valid."** Maybe I can even say that I used machine learning to do machine learning? I'm not sure. I find it amusing and exciting that despite never having learned machine learning before, I was able to achieve a high accuracy rate in an ML Challenge. This challenge is still a challenge for machine learning students, yet I managed to succeed (with cheating).
